get their executable called bash in your path), for example:
`#!/usr/bin/env bash` #lends you some flexibility on different systems
`#!/usr/bin/bash`        #gives you explicit control on a given system of what executable is called

In some situations, the first may be preferred (like running python scripts with multiple versions of python, without having to rework the executable line). But in situations where security is the focus, the latter would be preferred, as it limits code injection possibilities.
