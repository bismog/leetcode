This project is just for self-practice, no special usage.

Before running, replace some string to what you actually are:
grep -ril project0xxx | xargs -i sed -i 's/project0xxx/the-one-you-actually-are/gI'
These could be companyxxx, project0xxx, projectxxx,workidxxx.
But for case sensitive, you should rejust it in need.
